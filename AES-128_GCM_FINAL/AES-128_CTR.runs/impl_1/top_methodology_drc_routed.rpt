2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-190#1 Warning
Suboptimally placed synchronized register chain  
The FDRE cell u_keystream_fifo/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/rstblk/grstd1.grst_full.grst_f.rst_d2_reg in site SLICE_X57Y59 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDSE cell u_keystream_fifo/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/rstblk/grstd1.grst_full.grst_f.rst_d3_reg is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance U_Global_Key_Expansion/subword_in_reg_reg_rep, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance w_reg[4][23]_i_3, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance w_reg[4][31]_i_6, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rst relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on uart_rxd relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on uart_txd relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>
